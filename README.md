## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Problem
Many people possess valuable knowledge and skills (such as cooking, basic repairs, music, design, handcrafts, languages, and so on), but they do not have the platform to share it without being certified experts or part of teaching institutions.
At the same time, there’s a growing number of people interested in learning from practical experience, with a closer, more flexible, and more economic view compared to traditional courses.
Modern platforms tend to impose subscription models, high costs, or a focus on traditional academic content, which leaves behind the people who search for a space more open to community, flexibility, and practicality.

### 1.2. The Solution
A marketplace platform for skill sharing and community courses, where:
- Any user can create and offer courses based on their skills
- Students can get access to courses using a credit system, which can be earned through offering courses or paying money.
- Teachers can cash in their credits for money if they become app affiliates.
- Trust is fostered through community reviews and ratings.
- The complexity of subscription models is avoided, giving way to a fairer, more flexible system.

### 1.3 GoLearn

GoLearn is more than just an app; it is a community that empowers people to learn from real experiences and sharing their knowledge, regardless of formal credentials

We believe in democratizing education and making practical skills accessible and rewarding for everyone 

***GoLearn**: Knowledge for everyone, shared by everyone*

## 3. Strategy

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas illustrates how GoLearn connects its offering with the real needs and aspirations of its users, creating a balance between what learners seek and what the platform delivers

#### Customer Segments

Our main users are individuals eager to learn and teach practical skills in a flexible, community-driven environment.

#### Value Proposition

GoLearn offers a marketplace for community-based learning, empowering users to both teach and learn in a fair, accessible ecosystem.

### 3.2. UX Personas

Through interviews and surveys with college students, we landed on these personas which represent the different realities behind GoLearn

#### Carolina Vargas

### 3.3. Benchmarking

In order to develop an app which meets the needs and wants of our users, we analyzed other platforms currently available, in order to figure out what works and what doesn't from them.
For this, we selected five other skill sharing platforms: Udemy, Domestika, SkillShare, Coursera and Fiverr

These stages can be seen explained in detail down below

![Customer Journey Map](assets/journey-map-GoLearn.png)

#### 4.1.1 Decision Stage Interfaces

Decision Stage Interfaces

The Decision Stage represents the moment when users make key choices within GoLearn — joining the platform, creating a course, or enrolling in one. The interfaces developed for this stage prioritize clarity, simplicity, and confidence in decision-making, ensuring that users can act smoothly according to their goals.

##### User Activities and Goals

- **New Users:** Create an account or log in to start exploring the platform.  
Goal: Begin their learning or teaching journey quickly and effortlessly.

- **Aspiring Instructors:** Use the Crear Curso flow to design and publish their own courses.   
Goal: Share their knowledge and reach an audience through a guided, structured process.

- **Learners:** Explore the Home and Course View interfaces to evaluate and enroll in courses.   
Goal: Discover valuable learning opportunities and invest credits with confidence.

- **All Users:** Manage or purchase credits to facilitate transactions within the platform.   
Goal: Maintain autonomy and control over their learning and teaching economy.

#### Touchpoints

- **Landing Page:** The first interaction where users discover GoLearn’s purpose and offerings.

- **Sign Up / Login:** Entry point that enables personalized access and engagement.

- **Home Page:** Central navigation hub connecting to courses, profiles, and credits.

- **Course Creation:** Main touchpoint for instructors to publish and monetize their knowledge.

- **Course View:** Decision interface for learners to assess and enroll in courses.

- **Credits Interface:**  Financial touchpoint enabling smooth and transparent transactions.


## 5. Structure

### 5.1. Navigation Flow

The navigation flow illustrates how users move through the GoLearn platform, from discovering courses to offering their own. It ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for both learners and teachers.

This flow was used as a reference for the design of the interfaces and guided the layout, interaction patterns, and key user actions, helping us create a cohesive and user-friendly experience across the platform.

## 6. Skeleton

### 6.1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

To define the structure and layout of the platform, we created low-fidelity wireframes that outline the main navigation flow, core screens, and interaction logic of GoLearn. They serve as the foundation for the next visual and interaction design decisions.

You can explore them through the following link:

## 7. Interfaces

### 7.1. Interface Evolution

The design process of GoLearn’s interface evolved progressively from low-fidelity wireframes to high-definition (HD) prototypes, emphasizing usability, clarity, and visual hierarchy. Early wireframes primarily defined structure and functionality, focusing on organizing core elements such as navigation, course information, and user profiles. Through iterative refinement, each interface component was adjusted based on coherence, balance, and user experience feedback.

By the HD stage, visual elements were enhanced with color, typography, and spacing to create a more engaging and intuitive environment. Functional improvements—such as clearer presentation of course pricing, differentiated user profile views, and simplified navigation—reflected a deeper understanding of user needs. Overall, the evolution from wireframe to HD design demonstrates a transition from conceptual structure to a polished, user-centered interface that aligns both aesthetics and functionality.

Following, some examples:

![Create Course 1](assets/evolutions/41.png)
![Create Course 2](assets/evolutions/42.png)

### 7.2. High-Definition Interfaces

The final HD interfaces represent the culmination of GoLearn’s design process.

The result is a cohesive and user-friendly experience that successfully meets the project’s goals. Navigation feels natural, information is clearly organized, and the visual design reinforces the platform’s identity.
