## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. The Problem
Many people possess valuable knowledge and skills (such as cooking, basic repairs, music, design, handcrafts, languages, and so on), but they do not have the platform to share it without being certified experts or part of teaching institutions.
At the same time, there’s a growing number of people interested in learning from practical experience, with a closer, more flexible, and more economic view compared to traditional courses.
Modern platforms tend to impose subscription models, high costs, or a focus on traditional academic content, which leaves behind the people who search for a space more open to community, flexibility, and practicality.
### 1.2. The Solution
A marketplace platform for skill sharing and community courses, where:
- Any user can create and offer courses based on their skills
- Students can get access to courses using a credit system, which can be earned through offering courses or paying money.
- Teachers can cash in their credits for money if they become app affiliates.
- Trust is fostered through community reviews and ratings.
- The complexity of subscription models is avoided, giving way to a fairer, more flexible system.

### 3.2. UX Personas

Through interviews and surveys with college students, we landed on these personas which represent the different realities behind GoLearn

#### Carolina Vargas
> “I want to earn money doing what I love, leveraging my existing social media audience”

#### Sofia Martinez
> “I want to pick up new skills for fun and personal enrichment, without having to invest large amounts of money”

#### Camila Castro
> “I want to showcase my skills in a practical way, and generate additional income along the way”

### 3.3. Benchmarking

In order to develop an app which meets the needs and wants of our users, we analyzed other platforms currently available, in order to figure out what works and what doesn't from them.
For this, we selected five other skill sharing platforms: Udemy, Domestika, SkillShare, Coursera and Fiverr
